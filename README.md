# 📝 To-Do App

This is a basic To-Do application where users can add, delete, and manage tasks efficiently. I built this project to strengthen my understanding of:

- ✅ DOM Manipulation
- 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript
- 🔁 Working with Promises
- 💡 Structuring scalable JavaScript code

## 🔧 Features
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Save tasks (with simulated async using Promises)

## 📚 What I Learned
- Selecting and modifying elements dynamically using the DOM
- Creating reusable classes and methods with OOP concepts
- Handling async flows and simulating APIs with Promises

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
